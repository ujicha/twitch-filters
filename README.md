# twitch-filters
A Chrome plugin that adds filtering/highlighting options to help browse streams on Twitch. This is currently meant to be used with the BetterTTV dark theme. While it will work without BetterTTV or with the default theme it does not yet have a light theme and may be hard to read.

Features
- Highlight followed games in purple and followed streams in green
- Hide specific games
- Hide specific channels
